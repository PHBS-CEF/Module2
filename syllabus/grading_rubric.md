# Module 2 Grading Rubric

The grade for module 2 of the computational economics and finance sequence will be determined via
four channels.

| Assessment type | Number of assessments | Percent of grade |
| --------------- | --------------------- | ---------------- |
| In-class quiz   | 3+                    | 10%              |
| Homework        | 4+                    | 25%              |
| Exam            | 1                     | 25%              |
| Project         | 1                     | 40%              |


**Homework**

Much like learning to play a sport, learning Python and the corresponding numerical tools we cover
in this class require practice. The homeworks give students an opportunity to practice their
skills and to understand what the gaps in their knowledge are _before_ they take their exams.

We will assign at least 4 homeworks. The lowest score will be dropped.

**(In-class) Participation and Quizzes**

The quizzes are another way that we intend to check-in on what the students still have questions
about.

We will give at least 3 quizzes throughout the semester. The lowest score will be dropped.

**Exam**

The exam for this course should be viewed as a "learning exercise" and the goal will be to guide
you through a simple analysis of a dataset that you are given.

**Project**

The main deliverable for this course is the project. The project is a key opportunity for you to demonstrate what you have learned in this class (as well as Module 1). The two key learning objectives are:

1. Demonstrate mastery of skills and theories taught in the classes
2. Effectively carry out and **communicate** the results of analytical work
